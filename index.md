Hello! I'm Matthew Hopkins, a third-year PhD student at the University of Oxford, working with Chris Lintott and Michele Bannister on interstellar objects with both a planetary and Galactic perspective.

## [The Galactic Interstellar Object Population: A Framework for Prediction and Inference](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023AJ....166..241H/abstract)
Using the APOGEE stellar survey I made a model of the Milky Way disk, then combined this with a protoplanetary disk chemical model to predict how the composition of the ISO population will vary across our Galaxy. We find the well-known radial metallicity gradient has a corresponding ISO composition gradient! I also define a Bayesian inference framework to make inferences about the processes which affect the observable ISO population from the properties of the ISOs we observe.

# Other interests

Outside of astronomy I enjoy reading, climbing and playing the trombone.

Here's a cool photo I took at UC Mt John Observatory:
